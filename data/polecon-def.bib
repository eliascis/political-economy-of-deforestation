  abstract = {Protecting the world’s remaining forests is a global policy priority. Even though the value of the world’s remaining forests is global in nature, much of the protection has to come from national policies. Here, we combine global, high resolution remote sensing data on forest outcomes (tree-cover loss, forest degradation, net primary production) and two complementary econometric research designs for causal inference to first quantify how much it matters in which country a forest is located, secondly, the role of public policies, and third, under which conditions such pubic policies tend to be most successful. We find considerable border discontinuities in remotely sensed forest outcomes around the world (in a regression discontinuity design) and these are largely explained by countries’ policies (using a differences-in-discontinuities design). We estimate that public policies reduce the risk of tree cover loss by almost 4 percentage points globally, but there is large variation around this. The best explanations we find for these heterogenous treatment effects are a country’s policy enforcement, its policy stringency, its property rights, and its rule of law (in that order). Our results motivate international cooperation to finance and improve (a) countries’ public policies for forest protection and (b) countries’ capacity to implement and enforce them well.},

  year      = {2023},
  abstract  = {State decentralization is often promoted as a way to improve public service delivery. However, its effects on forests are ambiguous. Decentralization might not only improve local forest governance, but also change the incentives to promote agricultural expansion into forests. This study focuses on the power devolution stemming from the proliferation of new administrative units in Indonesia during the last two decades. The discontinuous changes in government responsibilities at new administrative borders provide exogenous spatial variation to study forest outcomes. Using a spatial boundary discontinuity design with 14,000 Indonesian villages, we analyze the effects of 115 district splits between 2002 and 2014. Results show a 35% deforestation decline within new (child) districts relative to the existing (mother) districts both immediately before and after the splitting. In pre-split years, these changes can be explained by agricultural divestment by the mother districts on territories that are soon to be lost. In post-split years, the short-term forest conservation benefits are neither rooted in an increased social cohesion nor stronger development. Instead, newly formed districts seem to be temporarily suffering from administrative incapacity to attract large-scale agricultural investments. In the long run, no lasting local forest conservation benefits persist as deforestation equalizes between child and mother districts a few years later.},

We begin by reviewing the methodological advances that have enabled measurement of forest loss at a fine spatial resolution across the globe. We then develop a simple benchmark model of deforestation based on classic models of natural resource extraction. Extending this approach to incorporate features that characterize deforestation in developing countries—pressure for land use change, significant local and global externalities, weak property rights, and political economy constraints—provides us with a framework for reviewing the fast-growing empirical literature on the economics of deforestation in the tropics. This combination of theory and empirics provides insights not only into the economic drivers and impacts of tropical deforestation but also into policies that may affect its progression. We conclude by identifying areas where more work is needed in this important body of research.},

Using a district–level panel data set from 2001 to 2016, we analyze variation in remotely sensed forest losses as well as measures of land-use licensing. We link these outcomes to political incentives arising before idiosyncratically–timed local mayoral elections as well as to price exposure measures based on oil palm soil suitability combined with global price variations for palm oil. Empirical results document increases of about 4% in deforestation in the year prior to local mayoral elections on average. Additionally, palm oil plays a crucial role in driving deforestation dynamics. Deforestation rates increase by 7% in places that experience a one standard deviation increase in local price exposure, but no upcoming elections. These effects are amplified to almost 19% larger forest losses in places that experience pre-election years and a standard deviation higher palm oil price exposure at the same time. We thus find clear evidence for economic and political incentives reinforcing each other as drivers of forest loss and land conversion for oil palm cultivation.},

We find that in areas where mineral extraction is relatively capital-intensive, mining booms cause virtually no upward pressure on manufacturing earnings per worker, and both producers of traded and local goods benefit from mining booms in terms of employment. In contrast, labour-intensive mining booms drive up local manufacturing wages such that producers of traded goods reduce employment. This source of heterogeneity helps to explain the mixed evidence for `Dutch disease' effects in the literature. In addition, we find no evidence that fiscal revenue sharing between sub-national districts leads to any spillovers.},

  abstract    = {In Indonesia annual forest fires between July and November raise substantial health, environmental and economic costs for Indonesia and its neighbours. In spite of substantial media and policy interest in the fires, there is little systematic quantitative analysis of the economic and political forces behind them. We utilize data on fires, rainfall, forests, and agricultural conditions and prices to analyze the role of two prospective channels: weak governance leading to underenforcement of laws against burning, and global demand for palm oil. First, we leverage plausibly exogenous variation in governance quality (through splits of administrative districts) that may alter local government capacity and incentives. While important prior work (Burgess et al., 2012) has shown that this can be a mechanism increasing overall deforestation, primarily through illegal logging, forest burning is arguably a significantly more publicly visible form of illegal activity, so may interact differently with governance dynamics. We show that an extra district per province leads to a 3-11.7% increase in the number of fires. However this effect is concentrated immediately after the time of a district split and in newly-created districts, suggesting the primary mechanisms are temporary factors such as weakened governance capacity in newly-created districts. Furthermore we present evidence that fires account for slightly under half of all deforestation in Indonesia. Second, we interact global palm oil prices with a measure of a district’s suitability for conversion to palm oil, showing that global palm oil demand substantially increases fire activity, particularly in the areas most suitable for conversion to palm oil. These results provide insights toward efforts to predict and prevent the fires, and deforestation more broadly.},

This article sets out a framework for measuring the cost effectiveness of alternative policies—both command-and-control and incentive-based—in the Brazilian Amazon. First, I estimate the demand for deforestation on private properties, exploiting regional variation in transportation costs as a means to recover farmers’ responses to permanent policies. Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers’ valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers’ willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers’ lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly). A carbon tax equal to the social cost of carbon could virtually eliminate all agricultural land in the Amazon, given the low agricultural returns there.}},

Using recent global satellite data from 2000 to 2012, I estimate the country-level avoided deforestation of protected areas established in this period via nearest-neighbor matching. I then use weighted least-squares regressions to explain country-level variation in estimated avoided deforestation as a function of a country’s governance characteristics as well as other country-level controls. Across 71 countries in this study period, protected areas were more effective in countries with higher levels of corruption control and protection of property rights, protected areas were more effective in more democratic countries, and there appears to be no relationship between political stability and avoided deforestation from protected areas.},

Starting in 2008, the {Brazilian} Ministry of the Environment has regularly published blacklists of critical districts with high annual forest loss. Farms in blacklisted districts face additional administrative hurdles to obtain authorization for clearing forests. In this paper we add to the existing literature on evaluating the {Brazilian} anti-deforestation policies by specifically quantifying the impact of blacklisting on deforestation. We first use spatial matching techniques using a set of covariates that includes official blacklisting criteria to identify control districts. We then explore the effect of blacklisting on change in deforestation in double difference regressions with panel data covering the period from 2002 to 2012. Multiple robustness checks are conducted including an analysis of potential causal mechanisms behind the success of the blacklist. We find that the blacklist has considerably reduced deforestation in the affected districts even after controlling for the potential mechanism effects of field-based enforcement, environmental registration campaigns, and rural credit.</p>},

  abstract  = {<p>Quasi-experimental methods increasingly are used to evaluate the impacts of conservation interventions by generating credible estimates of counterfactual baselines. These methods generally require large samples for statistical comparisons, presenting a challenge for evaluating innovative policies implemented within a few pioneering jurisdictions. Single jurisdictions often are studied using comparative methods, which rely on analysts’ selection of best case comparisons. The synthetic control method (SCM) offers one systematic and transparent way to select cases for comparison, from a sizeable pool, by focusing upon similarity in outcomes before the intervention. We explain SCM, then apply it to one local initiative to limit deforestation in the {Brazilian} {Amazon}. The municipality of Paragominas launched a multi-pronged local initiative in 2008 to maintain low deforestation while restoring economic production. This was a response to having been placed, due to high deforestation, on a federal “blacklist” that increased enforcement of forest regulations and restricted access to credit and output markets. The local initiative included mapping and monitoring of rural land plus promotion of economic alternatives compatible with low deforestation. The key motivation for the program may have been to reduce the costs of blacklisting. However its stated purpose was to limit deforestation, and thus we apply SCM to estimate what deforestation would have been in a (counterfactual) scenario of no local initiative. We obtain a plausible estimate, in that deforestation patterns before the intervention were similar in Paragominas and the synthetic control, which suggests that after several years, the initiative did lower deforestation (significantly below the synthetic control in 2012). This demonstrates that SCM can yield helpful land-use counterfactuals for single units, with opportunities to integrate local and expert knowledge and to test innovations and permutations on policies that are implemented in just a few locations.</p>},

Together, these results illustrates that better protection of the {Amazon} forest does not necessarily constrain agricultural production.},

  abstract = {The political context in Indonesia will affect the success of any reform process aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ({REDD+}). Such reforms require strong political support because of their potentially significant medium-term impact on winners and losers in the Indonesian economy. Although {REDD+} in Indonesia has strong rhetorical presidential backing, analysis of the political system suggests that such support may not be sufficient without the engagement and ownership of key players such as the parliament and the bureaucracy. Not only is the president's official power curtailed by the formal political system, but the nature of coalition politics in Indonesia further weakens his ability to implement reforms. Securing the support of a coalition of parties within parliament and the bureaucracy at both national and decentralised levels may be crucial to ensuring implementation. Politicisation of the bureaucracy and increasing business–government relationships are important features of the parliamentary dynamic at the national level and are reportedly intensifying at the local level. Although public support has proved influential for other reforms in Indonesia, the public is less informed or motivated by the issues related to {REDD+}. In addition, the {REDD+} debate is tainted by concerns about sovereignty and lack of national ownership. Building domestic constituencies for the reforms and associated institutions is therefore a key challenge. {REDD+} reforms will require a stronger consensus among political elites and the broader public over the implications of a transition to a ‘low carbon’ economy in Indonesia.},

Much of this deforestation is driven by illegal logging. We use novel satellite data that tracks annual deforestation across eight years of Indonesian institutional change to examine how local officials’ incentives affect deforestation. Increases in the number of political jurisdictions lead to increased deforestation and lower timber prices, consistent with Cournot competition between jurisdictions. Illegal logging and local oil and gas rents are short-run substitutes, but this effect disappears over time with political turnover. The results illustrate how local officials’ incentives affect deforestation and show how standard economic theories can explain illegal behavior.},

A new variable is added to the problem, the corrupt behavior. An analysis is made of how information asymmetry between the government and the official in charge of inspection may affect deforestation. By using Agency Theory, a simultaneous static game of complete/perfect information between the landowner and the official is simulated. Then, the resulting Nash equilibrium is analyzed. Results show that the actual relationship between the government and the {Brazilian} Institute for Environment and Natural Resources officials ({IBAMA}) promote incentive for collusion. Also, the results shown that a policy oriented, only to surveillance of landowners is a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the conservation of the {Amazon} rainforest. Also, harsher policies may lead, in some cases, to increased illegal deforestation.},

We use this framework to study empirically deforestation patterns at the rainforest margin. To this end we specify an empirical model that can explore the causal chain ranging from geographic conditions via institutional change to economic development and deforestation. We estimate this model using a unique data set of villages at the rainforest margin in Indonesia. Our results show that geography-induced institutional change is the key driver of technological change in our villages. The bad news is that some of these processes along the causal chain seem to promote deforestation. The good news is that economic development, conditional on these effects, appears to reduce deforestation. --},

This finding remains valid in both univariate and multivariate models. Also, the model takes the potential heteroscedasticity problem, common in cross-section studies, into account and makes correction if necessary. To our best knowledge, this study is the first cross-country study addressing to the issue by utilizing all available corruption indices, namely Corruption Perception Index (CPI), International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index, and Business Intelligence (BI) index. Policies and measures taken towards reducing corruption, therefore, may help to decrease illegal forest activities (e.g. illegal logging and timbering, smuggling of forest products etc.) and in turn depletion of forests.},

  abstract  = {Despite growing concern over the extent and consequences of tropical deforestation in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is continuining unabated. This article maintains that a key reason for the failure to slow deforestation is the inadequacy of conventional explanations. These provide important insights into the specific agents and underlying causes of deforestation but do not sufficiently explain the process which leads to the destruction of tropical forests. To better understand this process, it is necessary to examine the politics which shape and drive the various factors contributing to deforestation. In the case of Indonesia, a centralized military-dominated leadership, attitudes of the Javanese decision makers, institutionalized corruption, an emphasis on stability and national integration, a political system which mainly benefits the elite, and financial and technical support frominternational institutions and Northern countries, especially Japan, encourage deforestation while protecting interests which exploit the forests. This political context increases the environmental impact of land clearing for agriculture, large-scale development projects, logging, poverty, population growth and poorly designed government policies. As a result, Indonesia continues to lose nine hundred thousand hectares of forest every year. The analysis suggests that to decrease the rate of forest loss in Indonesia it is essential to recognize and reshape political institutions and attitudes driving deforestation-only then will effective solutions be possible.},
